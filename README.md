# Bike sharing system - using linear regression

A bike-sharing system is a service that provides bicycles for shared use, allowing individuals to rent a bike for short periods. These systems typically feature computer-controlled docking stations where users can unlock a bike by entering payment information. The rented bike can be returned to any docking station within the same network, offering a convenient and flexible transportation option.
